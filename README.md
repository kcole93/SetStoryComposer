# SetStoryComposer: Quickly Assign A Composer to All of Your Document's Stories

This InDesign script allows the user to set all stories in a given document to use the selected composer. This can be quite useful for translating and typesetting documents using complex non-Latin scripts (Indic/Devengari, etc.)

# Installation
To install this script, download the [SetStoryComposer.jsx](/SetStoryComposer.jsx) file and place it in your Scripts Panel directory. 

For more information about where to locate the Scripts Panel directory on your OS, see Adobe's help page: https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/using/scripting.html

# Activating the Script
To run the script after installing, navigate to the Scripts Panel:  
`Window > Utilities > Scripts`

Then, expand the `User` directory in the Scripts Panel and click 'ConvertAllStories'. A dialog box will ask you to select the desired composer.
